|Is the slot booking form mandatory to fill?|The slot booking feature allows students to schedule dedicated time slots to learn on the ViBe platform. From now on, students can book learning slots in advance as part of a commitment-based learning system. Each day, a total of 24 slots are available. Students may: -> Choose any number of slots based on their availability. -> Commit a specific percentage of course progress they plan to complete during those selected slots. Once a slot is booked, the student is expected to be active on ViBe during that time. If a student does not attend or engage during their booked slots, penalties may be applied, as the system treats slot booking as a commitment. This for the benefit of the student to commit and progress each day during the internship track. It is not mandatory but committing will ultimately help the participant in progressing further in the course.||
